Changes from 2.5 to 2.6:

* Added this CHANGELOG. :P
* Users may now give wrong terms in their programs.
* New syntactic sugar for the 'typed' system: assert (condition) "error message";
  which expands to:  if condition then unit else wrong "error message";
* TpError and TpWrong are now two different types:
  The first is concerned with type errors, the latter with user-defined errors.
* Parsers now skip initial whitespace.
